#  NHS DIDS Explorer

A structured Python-based environment for exploring the NHS **Diagnostic Imaging Dataset (DIDS)**. This project enables reproducible analysis of pseudonymised patient-level imaging data across demographics, modalities, geography, and referral pathways.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyse trends in diagnostic activity across time, region, and population groups
- Explore modality usage by age, sex, ethnicity, and condition (e.g. cancer)
- Map referrals by organisation, GP practice, and healthcare system
- Visualise imaging activity by geography (LSOA/MSOA/Region)
- Build reusable scripts and notebooks for NHS research and planning
