This aligns with the findings in the source report.\n",

For example, the `Month_2` (February) coefficient of ~-69,000 suggests that, on average, February's value is 69,000 units lower than December's, holding other factors constant. Months like July, October, and November have p-values > 0.05, meaning their values are not statistically different from December's, once trend and pandemic effects are accounted for.\n",

    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Consistent Regional Pattern**: The NHS SW Region as a whole exhibits a strong, predictable seasonal pattern with a trough in the early months and a peak late in the year. This pattern is superimposed on a statistically significant positive long-term trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Major Structural Break**: The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant structural break, not a seasonal feature. Its impact was quantified by the regression model, showing a large, negative effect on activity levels that must be explicitly modeled to avoid analytical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Significant ICB Heterogeneity**: The deep dive analysis confirms that seasonal patterns are not uniform across all ICBs. For instance:\n",
    "    * Category **15N** shows a very strong peak in October and November.\n",
    "    * Category **11J** often peaks in the middle of the year (May, June, July), a pattern almost opposite to that of 15N.\n",
    "    * Category **11M** displays much greater volatility compared to others, suggesting a different underlying process.\n",
    "    This heterogeneity means that effective operational planning requires category-specific models rather than relying solely on the aggregate forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classical Decomposition**: Best for initial exploratory analysis and generating an intuitive, visual separation of the time series components. Its primary output, the seasonally adjusted series, is ideal for high-level reporting.\n",
    "* **Regression with Dummy Variables**: Best for formal statistical inference. It provides quantifiable estimates (coefficients) and statistical significance (p-values) for seasonality, trend, and interventions, which are invaluable for budgeting and performance evaluation.\n",
    "* **Differencing and Stationarity Testing**: Primarily a data preparation technique. Achieving stationarity is a mandatory prerequisite for building advanced stochastic forecasting models like SARIMA.\n",

    "### Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has successfully replicated and expanded upon the analysis from the source report. We have characterized the time series data for the NHS SW Region and its ICBs, identified key patterns and events, and prepared the data for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis confirms the importance of a dual approach: understanding the macro-level regional trends while also modeling the unique, heterogeneous behavior of each individual ICB for effective operational planning. The stationary data series generated in this notebook are now ready for the development of sophisticated forecasting models."
